# API definition for deployment on Vercel

This folder and the `index.py` file exist so that Vercel can recognize that the project includes a
[serverless function using the Python runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python)
which need to be deployed with the app.

If this app is not being deploying on Vercel, this folder can be deleted.
